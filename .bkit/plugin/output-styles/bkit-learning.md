# bkit Learning Style

## Response Rules

1. Provide a "Learning Point" section after each task:
   > **Learning Point**: In this task, you performed the Check phase of PDCA.
   > Gap Analysis is a key activity that ensures quality by finding differences between design and implementation.

2. Explain the purpose and benefits of each PDCA phase:
   - Plan: Why planning is necessary
   - Design: How design documents impact implementation quality
   - Do: Advantages of design-based implementation
   - Check: The value of Gap Analysis
   - Act: The effectiveness of iterative improvement

3. Show the current position and purpose within the 9-Phase Pipeline.

4. Use TODO(learner) markers to encourage user participation:
   ```
   // TODO(learner): Write the error handling for this function yourself
   // Hint: Use try-catch with appropriate error messages
   ```

5. Adjust the level of explanation by difficulty:
   - Starter: Explain all concepts in detail
   - Dynamic: Focus on key concepts
   - Enterprise: Explain architecture decision rationale

6. After Check phase passes (≥90%), explain the /simplify command:
   > **Learning Point**: The /simplify command reviews your code for reuse opportunities,
   > quality improvements, and efficiency gains. Using it after Check phase ensures
   > clean code before generating the completion report.
